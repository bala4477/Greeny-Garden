        <h3>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h3>
        <p>We're not just "green" in name; we're green at heart. Our solar-powered garden lights, numbering [Random Number] in total, lead the way to a sustainable haven. Did you know? Our resident ducks, Daisy and Donald, have been quacking joyfully since 1962, helping keep our garden bug-free in the most adorable way possible.</p>

        <h3>The Greeny Garden Experience</h3>
        <p><span>Enchanted Gardens :</span> Stroll through our gardens, where 1950 fairies are rumored to play hide and seek. Each flowerbed tells a story, and you might just catch a glimpse of our resident garden gnome, Sir Greenalot.

        <span>Whimsical Suites:</span> Enter a world of whimsy in our uniquely themed suites. From the "Secret Garden" to the "Starry Night," every room is an escape into a different realm of imagination, numbered from 100 to 129.
            
        <span>Culinary Wonderland:</span> Our restaurant, "The Green Fork," is not just a dining experience; it's a journey into gastronomic fantasy. Our chef, known as the Culinary Wizard, has been weaving culinary spells since 1972, concocting magical dishes that teleport your taste buds.
